16	1	1877	1911	false	false	true	Deskilling of labor	employees were deskilled when performing small-scale tasks rather than completing an entire project. As industrialization advanced, workers increasingly lost the independence of craft work. While employers favored automation because it increased output, control workers and cut labor costs, workers begrudged that they "cannot be a master of a craft, but only a master of a fragment."
16	1	1877	1911	false	false	true	Scientific Management	the application of scientific principles to increase efficiency in the workplace. Frederick Taylor recommended that employers eliminate all brain work from manual labor, hiring experts to develop rules for the shop floor. Workers must "do what they are told promptly and without asking questions or making suggestions."

16	1	1877	1911	false	false	true	Health Hazards and Pollution	Industrial labor also damaged worker's health. Many killed, disabled by accidents on the job (eg Brakemen, miners) or being exposed to pollution or contaminants (Pittsburgh's belching smokestakes meant coughing and lung damage). Many faced brutal working conditions. Many people were aware of the conditions but had an even more urgent priority: work to earn a wage to avoid starvation.

16	2	1877	1911	true	false	false	First Wave of Immigration	Major immigration to America from Europe, especially Catholic Irish and Germans. Irish generally stayed on the East Coast, and worked in low paying, menial factories, where they were treated awfully. Germans tended to head West because they had more money and were looking to start a new life. Germans were mostly just men while the Irish came in families. It helped start the Industrial Revolution and led to Nativism.
16	2	1877	1911	true	false	false	Second Wave of Immigration	Period of immigration beginning in the 1880s. Immigrants arrived from southern and eastern Europe - Among them were Russians, Italians, Greeks, and Poles. Many fled political dissent and crumbling peasant economies at home. While some brought skills, industrialization required large quantities of unskilled labor. As poor farmers from Italy, Greece, and Eastern Europe arrived in USA, heavy, low-paid labor became their domain.
16	2	1877	1911	true	false	false	Sojourners	people who move into new cultural contexts for a limited period of time and for a specific purpose, such as for study or business. Some immigrants had hoped to earn enough money to return home, but many ended up staying a lifetime. 1/3 of immigrants from the Second Wave returned to their home countries after expecting to settle permanently and founding themselves forced to leave due to an accident, sudden economic depression or feelings of hostility.

In the next 4 decades, 3 million poverty-stricken Jews arrived from Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other parts of Eastern Europe, transforming the Jewish presence in the USA. Like other immigrants, they sought economic opportunity but also came to escape religious repression.
16	2	1877	1911	true	false	false	Chinese-Americans	Compared with Europeans, newcomers from Asia faced even harsher treatment. The first Chinese immigrants arrived in late 1840s during the California gold rush. After the Civil War, the Burlingame Treaty between the USA and China opened the way for increasing numbers to emigrate. Fleeing poverty and upheaval in southern China, they, like European immigrants, filled low-wage jobs in the American economy. During the depression of the 1870s, a rising tide of racism was especially extreme in the Pacific coast states, where the majority of Chinese immigrants lived.

The ban was supposed to last 10 years, but it was expanded several times and was essentially in effect until WWII. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first significant law that restricted immigration into the United States of an ethnic working group. Extreme example of nativism of period. The law created the legal foundation on which far-reaching exclusionary policies would be built in the 1920s and after. To enforce the laws, Congress and the Courts gave sweeping new powers to immigration officials, transforming the Chinese into America's first illegal immigratns.
16	2	1877	1911	true	false	false	Chinese/Japanese/Korean-American citizenship	Well into the 20th century, Chinese immigrants (as opposed to native-born Chinese-Americans) could not apply for citizenship. In 1906, the US Attorney General ruled that Japanese and Koreans too were barred from citizenship.

When Pennsylvania's governor sent into the state militia to break the strike, Pittsburgh crows reacted by burning railroad property and overturning locomotives. Similar clashes with law enforcement occurred in Galveston, Texas and San Francisco. More than 50 died and $40 million worth of damage occurred. Many railroad workers were fired or blacklisted. The National Guard was created not just to protect against foreign invasion but to enforce order at home.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Henry George	He wrote Progress and Poverty in 1879, which made him famous as an opponent of the evils of modern capitalism. He warned that Americans had been too optimistic about the railroads and manufacturing, instead suggesting that emerging industrial order meant permanent poverty. Industrialization was a driving wedge for society, lifting the fortunes of professionals and the middle class at the expense of the working class that was forced into deskilled, dangerous and low-paid labor. He proposed a federal "single-tax" on landholdings but it did not win support.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Wage Gap: Farmers v. Corporations	In the new economy, farmers found themselves at the mercy of large corporations, from equipment dealers who sold them harvesters and plows to railroads and grain elevators that shipped and stored their products. Farmers felt trapped in a web of middlemen who chipped away at their profits while international forces robbed them of decision-making power.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Farmer Political Activitism	Farmers argued that high tariffs forced rural families to pay too much for basic necessities while failing to protect America's great export crops, cotton and wheat. They also charged Republican financial policies to benefit the banks, not borrowers. Farmers blamed railroad companies for taking government grants and subsidies to build but then charging unequal rates that privileged big manufacturers. Public money, they said, built giant railroad companies that turned around to exploit ordinary people.

16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Producerism	The argument that real economic wealth is created by workers who make their living by physical labor, such as farmers and craftsmen, and that merchants, lawyers, bankers, and other middlemen unfairly gain their wealth from such "producers."
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Grange Halls	The grange became a union of agricultural people set up to fight the railroad pricing of freight travel. They set up their own banks, insurance companies, and grain elevators, and, in Iowa, even a farm implement factory. They built indpendent local parties that ran on anticorporate platforms eventually leading to the Greenback Labor Party.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Greenback Labor Party	Political party devoted to improving the lives of laborers and raising inflation, reaching its high point in 1878 when it polled over a million votes and elected fourteen members of Congress. In the South, they protested the collapse of Reconstruction and urged that every man's vote be protected. They advocated fro laws to regulate corporations and enforce and 8-hour workday to reduce long, grueling work hours. They called for the federal government to print more greenback dollars and increase the amount of money in circulation which would stimulate the economy, create jobs, and help borrowers pay off debts in dollars.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Granger Laws	A set of economic regulatory laws designed to address railroad discrimination against small farmers, covering issues like freight rates and railroad rebates. These resulted due to the pressure mounted by the Greenbacks. They served as the starting point to counter laisse-faire policies with reform and regulation of big business.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Knights of Labor	Founded in 1869 but gained steam during the Greenback-Labor movement. Like the Grangers, they believed that ordinary people needed control over the enterprises in which they worked. They proposed to set up shops owned by employees and transform America into cooperative commonwealth. They practiced open membership, irrespective of race, gender or field of employment, although they excluded Chinese immigrants. They demanded workplace safety laws, prohibition of child labor, a federal tax on the nation's highest incomes, and government recognition of workers' right to organize. They advocated personal responsibility and self-discipline, warning of the perils of liquor to rob their wages as much as ruthless employers. Grassroots organization was decentralized, diverse which allowed almost 750,000 members by 1885.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Haymarket Square Incident	In 1886, a protest at the McCormick reaper works in Chicago led to class with police that left four Knights of Labor strikers dead. 100,000 workers rioted in Chicago. After the police fired into the crowd, the workers met and rallied in Haymarket Square to protest police brutality. A bomb exploded, killing or injuring many of the police. The Chicago workers and the man who set the bomb were immigrants, so the incident promoted anti-immigrant and labor feelings. The incident profoundly damaged the American labor movement. Seizing on hysteria, and attaching the labor movement to anarchism, employers took to the offensive, breaking strikes and making arrests. They tied up the Knights of Labor in expensive court proceedings, forced workers to sign contracts pledging not to join labor organizations.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Farmers' Alliance	A Farmers' organization founded in late 1870s; worked for lower railroad freight rates, lower interest rates, and a change in the governments tight money policy. It arose to take up many of the issues that the Grangers and Greenbackers had earlier sought to address. Largest farmer-based movement in American history. They hoped to create cooperative stores and exchanges to circumvent middlemen. Their cooperatives largely failed from chronic underfunding, lack of credit, hostility from merchants and lenders. They then tried to create a federal price-support system that would hold crops in public warehouses and issue loans on their value until they could be profitably sold. States-rights Southern Democrats considered it too radical. Alliances in Texas, Kansas and South Dakota created a new political party called the Populists.

16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Interstate Commerce Act	Established the ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission) - monitors the business operation of carriers transporting goods and people between states - created to regulate railroad prices. It counteracted the Supreme Court's decision in Wabash v. Illinois from the prior year which had struck down states' authority to regulate railroads. It charged with investigating interstate shipping, forcing railroads to make their rates public, and suing in court when necessary to make companies reduce "unjust or unreasonable" rates. Although the Courts curtailed its authority in the 19th century, the ICC would become one of the most powerful federal agencies charged with overseeing private business in the 20th century.

Dutch-Jewish cigar maker had immigrated to NYC in 1863. He rejected the electoral strategy and critical approach to capitalism that had been the strategy of the Knights. Instead, he worked within the corporate system to advance a larger share of its rewards for workers. He advocated "pure-and-simple unionism".
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	American Federation of Labor (AFL)	a national organization of labor unions founded in 1886 by Samuel Gompers. After Haymarket violence, many left to set up this union. Far less welcoming to women and blacks than the Knights. It included mostly skilled craftsmen. It did not include clerks or service workers or farm tenants and domestic servants that had supported the Knights. Although successful in organization and results, it was narrow in its membership which would haunt labor movement later on. However, Gompers tactfully set up a defense plan against powerful Robber Barrons.

Skilled occupation tradesmen sought these "brotherhoods" to keep out lower-wage workers, set up collective funds for accidents and death benefits, advocate for decision-making in the workplace as opposed to cogs in a management-run shop.
16	3	1877	1911	true	false	true	Pure-and-Simple Unionism	Advocated by Samuel Gompers; 1) strictly limited to workers, organized by craft and occupation, with no reliance on outside advisors or allies; 2) goals are only those that immediately benefited workers - better wages, hours, and working conditions. It distrusted politics and the aim was collective-bargaining with employers. It was successful at turning AFL into 2 million by 1904 and battled anti-union Congress and Supreme Court.

17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	On the Origin of Species	1859: Charles Darwin's book explained how various species evolve over time and only those with advantages can survive and reproduce. When individual members of a species are born with random genetic mutations that better suit them for their environment (eg camouflage coloring for a moth), these characteristics, since there are heritable or genetically transmissible, become dominant in future generations.

17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Herbert Spencer	English philosopher and sociologist who wrongly applied the theory of natural selection to human societies (1820-1903). He spun an elaborate theory of how human societies advanced through ruthless competitive struggle, resulting in "survival of the fittest." He applied this particularly to capitalism and industry.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Social Darwinism	The application of ideas about evolution and "survival of the fittest" to human societies - particularly as a justification for their imperialist expansion. Originally theorized by Herbert Spencer but championed by William Graham Sumner, an American Yale sociologist. Competition, said Sumner, was a law of nature, like gravity. Sumner argued that Millionaires were the fittest because success showed they were "naturally selected." These views bolstered the pride and self-justification of industrial titans such as Andrew Carnegie. The theory was controversial in its day. Today, the scientific community virtually unanimously rejects the application of biological findings to the realm of economics and society. Critics revolted in the 20th century, arguing the theory was merely a justification or excuse for the worst excesses of industrialization.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Eugenics Movement	a campaign that sought to improve the quality of humankind through carefully controlled selective breeding. The so-called "science of human breeding" argued that mentally deficient people should be prevented from reproducing and to sterilize those deemed "unfit," especially residents of state asylums for the insane or mentally disabled. In early 20th century, almost half of the states enacted eugenics laws, leading to tens of thousands of people being sterilized by the time the movement subsided in the 1930s.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Racial Intermarriage Policies	Advocates of Eugenics also justified racial purity, defining "lower races" to support Jim Crow segregation laws and racial discrimination. Between 1870-1910s, most states in the South and West passed laws prohibiting interracial marriage, claiming that only separation of the races could foster human advancement. By warning that immigrants from Europe and Southern Europe would dilute White Americans' racial purity, eugenicists helped win passage of immigration restriction in the 1920s.

This was not the way of Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe, who arrived in large numbers to America after the 1880s.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Protestant Foreign Missions	One of the era's dramatic religious developments - facilitated by global steamship and telegraph lines. From a modest start before the Civil War, this movement peaked around 1915, a year when American religious organizations sponsored more than 9,000 overseas missionaries, supported at home by armies of volunteers, including more than 3 million women. A majority of them served in Asia, with smaller numbers posted to Africa and the Middle East. Protestant missionaries won concerts, in part, by providing such modern services as medical care and women's education. Some developed deep bonds of respect with the people they served. Others angrily denounced foreigners as corrupt, immoral and "heathen races", sometimes ended up justifying Western imperialism.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	American Protective Association (APA)	An organization created by nativists in 1887 that campaigned for laws to restrict immigration. More than 2 million members joined. This virulently nativist group expressed outrage at the existence of separate Catholic schools while demanding, at the same time, that all public schools teachers be protestants. They called for a ban on Catholic officeholders, believing Catholics would be loyal to the Pope and not America. The rise of this movement, prefigured the revival of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Social Gospel Movement	A social reform movement that developed within religious institutions and sought to apply the teachings of Jesus directly to society. They provided reading rooms, day nurseries, vocational classes, and other services. It was the goal of renewing religious faith through dedication to justice and social welfare. Its goals were epitomized by Charles Sheldon's novel "In His Steps" (1896). The Salvation Army, YMCA, and the Hull House were examples.

By the 1910s, a network of churches and Bible institutions had emerged from these conferences and called their movement "Fundamentalism," based upon their belief in the fundamental truth of the Bible.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Fundamentalism	Literal interpretation and strict adherence to basic principles of a religion (or a religious branch, denomination, or sect). Arose as a result of the Niagra Creed. Unlike the Social Gospel advocates, revivalists said little about poverty or earthly justice, focusing not on the matters of the world, but on heavenly redemption.

Inspired by the quest for facts, American authors rejected 19th century romanticism and what they saw as its unfortunate product, sentimentality. In the 1880s, editor/novelist William Dean Howells called for writers "to picture the daily life in the most exact terms possible," and dismissed stories always having "a happy ending"

He wrote "To Build a Fire" and "The Call of the Wild." A Literary Realist. He dramatized what he saw as a harsh reality of an uncaring universe. American society, he said, was "a jungle wherein wild beasts eat and are eaten." He and Stephen Crane suggested that humans were not rational sharpers of their destiny as much as blind victims of forces beyond their control, including their own subconscious impulses.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Modernism	A cultural movement embracing human empowerment and rejecting traditionalism as outdated. Rationality, industry, and technology were cornerstones of progress and human achievement. The first great literary and artistic movement of the 20th century, some photographers argued that photo's "true" representations made painting obsolete. Artists strove to reassert masculinity, rejecting 19th century romanticism as hopelessly feminine. It also paralleled Theodore Roosevelt's call for "manly sports" and Stephen Crane's call for "virility" in literature" and Jack London describing himself as "man's man, lustfully roving and conquering." Robert Henri banned small brushes as "too feminine". All these writers and artists contributed to a broad movement to masculinize American culture.
17	1	1880	1917	true	false	false	Armory Show of 1913	exposed American public to 1600 art works of contemporary European and American artists. It was a significant catalyst in the disseminating knowledge of recent developments in art. It introduced Americans to modern art. Some painters who work appeared at the show were experimenting with cubism, characterized by abstract, geometric forms. Along with works by Henri, Sloan, and Bellows, organizers featured paintings by European rebels such as Pablo Picasso. America's academic art world was shocked and some critics called cubism "the total destruction of the art of painting." But more than 250,000 people went to see the exhibition traveling from New York to Boston and Chicago.

He used the country's expanded rail network to develop his famous traveling circus. Condemning the earlier circuses that attracted the "rowdy element," he proclaimed children as his audience, creating family entertainment for diverse audiences (although segregation in the south still endured racial separation). He promised middle class parents that his circus would teach children courage and promote the benefits of exercise.

They lured middle class women by offering tearooms, children play areas, umbrellas, and clerks to wrap and carry every purchase. Store credit plans also helped to grow New York's department store district and catered to "Adamless Edens" who were elite and middle class women. Working class families did not shop here and working-class women gained access primarily as clerks and cashiers, helping to advance a class divide.

17	2	1880	1917	true	false	true	Railroads and Class Status	Like department stores, trains made things comfortable for middle class women and children. First class "ladies' cars" soon became sites of struggle for racial equality. Riding a railline in 1884, young African American journalist Ida B. Wells was told to leave. When she refused, she was forcibly and literally thrown off a moving train. She sued, winning in local courts but losing in Tennessee's Supreme Court. Finally Plessy v. Ferguson settled the broader dispute about separate but equal as constitutional until overturned in the 1950s. Business and consumer culture were shaped by, and themselves shaped, racial and class injustices and divide.
17	2	1880	1917	true	false	true	Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)	Legalized segregation in publicly owned facilities on the basis of "separate but equal." The Supreme Court ruled that segregation as ordered to leave a first-class railroad car and move to the "colored" care of a Louisiana train, did not violate the 14th Amendment as long as blacks had access to accommodations that were "separate but equal" to those of whites.

The war left Korea divided along the 38th parallel. The Korean War was an example of the U.S. Cold War policies of containment and militarization, setting the stage for the further enlargement of the U.S. defense perimeter in Asia (Vietnam). US committed troops without congressional approval which set a precedent for future undeclared wars. Defense expenditures grew from $13 billion in 1950, roughly 1/3 of the federal budget, to $50 billion in 1953, nearly 2/3 of the federal budget. American foreign policy had become more global, more militarized, and more expensive.
