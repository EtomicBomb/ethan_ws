# What is this project?

I wanted to write a web server, with a lot of the stuff from scratch 
(whatever I decide that means). At first, I thought it would be fun. You should 
try it sometime.

# What's included here?

There's a WebSocket server (which I think is the cool part), a few online games
and even a [programming language](lisp). I'm not using the programming language right now
because it's not very economic. 

# What is going to happen with this in the future?

Mostly I don't know. I think I want to improve the library so this can be used for a
wider variety of projects. There's a few limitations that I want to address, like 
the lack of a non-hacky way to implement HTTP response codes. And the no https thing.
