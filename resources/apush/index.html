<!--<p>I urge you not to think, "Oh, this exists, I don't need to study." Play around with it for a bit and see how not useful it is.-->
<!--    Realize that the chance it crashes on test day is pretty high. Realize that Mr. Connors-Long might ask me to take it down.-->
<!--    You can't do a DBQ with just vocab. You need some foundational understanding.</p>-->
<!--<p>This tool was thrown together pretty quick. It's not Google.</p>-->
<!--<p>If it's not working, make sure you hit the search button. If it's not that, then either my website crashed or your internet-->
<!--    connection is bad, or something else idk. Probably my server crashed.</p>-->
<!--<p>It's assumed that if you uncheck a theme, that you do not want to see terms that don't match the theme. The theme-->
<!--    checkboxes were thrown together by categorizing each subsection of a chapter by each theme by just-->
<!--    guessing and looking at the table of contents. Notably, stuff about war is categorized under politics.-->
<!--    Frankly, the reason society and culture are together has a lot to do with me not-->
<!--    knowing the difference between them. If they're not helping you, just leave them checked.</p>-->
<!--<p>This thing is running on a Raspberry Pi under my TV. This thing can't take any stress.</p>-->
<!--<p>Yeah it's very plain. If you have any experience with web design and you wanna help, shoot me something, I'm ewilliam0059.-->
<!--    FYI, the page source is on <a href="https://github.com/EtomicBomb/ethan_ws">GitHub</a> too.</p>-->
