<h1>Words</h1>
<p>I urge you not to think, "Oh, this exists, I don't need to study." Play around with it for a bit and see how not useful it is.
    Realize that the chance it crashes on test day is pretty high. Realize that Mr. Connors-Long might ask me to take it down
    for exam day. You can't do a DBQ with just vocab. You need some foundational understanding.</p>
<p>If you're questioning whether or not the College Board allows this, my answer is that in my opinion, I think they should. No
    content of the requests you make is sent back to my server, or any other users of this service. All of the searching
    happens entirely within your browser. This is the equivalent of downloading a file off of the internet and Control-F'ing
    it in Word. If you don't believe me, check yourself. Use Inspect Element/View Page Source/Wireshark or whatever you want to
    verify that the content of your searches stays with you. I can't speak for the College Board to say if they are actually cool with this.
    If they aren't, you're taking on the liability of using this tool.</p>
<p>I will probably continue to work on improving this tool. If you have any issues or specific suggestions, let me know.</p>
<p>If it's not working, make sure you hit the search button. If it's not that, then either my website crashed or your internet
    connection is bad, or something else idk. Probably my server crashed.</p>
<p>It's assumed that if you uncheck a theme, that you do not want to see terms that don't match the theme. The theme
    checkboxes were thrown together by categorizing each subsection of a chapter by each theme by just
    guessing and looking at the table of contents. Notably, stuff about war is categorized under politics.
    Frankly, the reason society and culture are together has a lot to do with me not
    knowing the difference between them. If they're not helping you, just leave them checked.</p>
<p>This thing is running on a Raspberry Pi under my TV. It can't take any stress.</p>
<p>Yeah it's very plain. If you have any experience with web design and you wanna help, shoot me something, I'm ewilliam0059.
    The source is on <a href="https://github.com/EtomicBomb/ethan_ws">GitHub</a> too.</p>
<p>If you want the raw data this searches (maybe to Control-F through), you should check out <a href="/apush/godset.txt">godset.txt</a>. This data was derived from
    <a href="https://quizlet.com/class/8606959/">Mr. Connors-Long's APUSH Quizlets</a>.</p>
